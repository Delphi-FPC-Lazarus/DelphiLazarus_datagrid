# DelphiLazarus_datagrid
Datagrid replacement class can replace stringgrid for Delphi and Lazarus

## What it is  
Compact Stringgrid compatible class
for non-visual and visual data storage
with memory and load function for the grid data.
Much faster and less memory usage than delphi's stringgrid. 

 - is limited to elementary functions
 - higher access speed
 - releases memory completely again without having to be resolved
 - Memory addressing not excessive, even with constant rowcounchange
 - automatic adjustment of memory address block size to better process data volumes >2M Recs
 - Stringgrid similar behaviour / access possibility
 - Visualization option without additional memory requirements
 - real and visualized number of columns may differ
 - internal storage as space-saving utf8
 - Save/load optionally ANSI or Unicode
